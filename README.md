PHP web application where you can sell and buy watches.


Website where you can browse watches as Guest or buy and sell watches as User. Other roles are Administrator and Moderator for website maintenance.
Application uses MVC architecture and its built with CodeIgniter framework.


This web application was created in group of 4 students. First phase was requirements specification where we specified all functionalities that are going to be implemented. Second phase was creating a prototype in Figma. Third phase was implementation phase. My task was to implement guest and user functionalities. Guest
can only browse watches and register. User can buy or sell watches, change his information, pay subscription, ask any questions inside chat support which are forwarded to moderator.
